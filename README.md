# JP-MORGANONLINE-INTERNSHIP

Based on my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have any specific information about a program called "JP-MORGANONLINE-INTERNSHIP." It's possible that this program has been introduced after my last update, or it could be a term or reference that is not widely known.

To obtain accurate and up-to-date information about the "JP-MORGANONLINE-INTERNSHIP," I suggest visiting the official website of JPMorgan Chase, the company behind the JP Morgan brand. Companies often provide comprehensive details about their internship programs, including application procedures, eligibility requirements, and program specifics on their official websites.

If this is a specific program within JPMorgan Chase, you may also consider reaching out to their human resources or recruitment department for further information. They can offer insights into the structure, objectives, and application process of the internship.

Remember to always rely on official and trustworthy sources when gathering information about internships or any programs, especially when it involves personal or sensitive information.

* Task 1 (Interface with a stock price data feed)

  - Car Class:
  
    Constructor: The __init__ method initializes a Car object with a default speed of 0. It also sets attributes for speed, odometer, and time.
    Accelerate: The accelerate method increases the car's speed by 5 units.
    Brake: The brake method decreases the car's speed by 5 units.
    Step: The step method updates the car's odometer based on its current speed and increments the time.
    Average Speed: The average_speed method calculates and returns the average speed of the car.
    
  - Main Section:

    In the main section, a new instance of the Car class called my_car is created. Then, a loop is initiated where the user is asked to input an action. They can choose to accelerate (A), brake (B), show the odometer (O), or show the average speed (S). Depending on the user's input, the script executes the corresponding action on the car and gives feedback. This loop will keep running until it is manually stopped.
